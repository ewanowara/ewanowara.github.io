I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Johns Hopkins University working with Prof. Rama Chellappa on geo-localizing natural images. I'm interested in computer vision, machine learning and computational imaging.

I received my Ph.D. from Rice University in 2021 where I was fortunate to work with Prof. Ashok Veeraraghavan in the Computational Imaging Group. My Ph.D. research focused on deep learning and computational imaging for robust unconstrained camera-based vital signs monitoring.

I interned at Los Alamos National Lab (T-5) with Brendt Wohlberg in 2020, Microsoft Research AI with Daniel McDuff in 2019, and Mitsubishi Electric Research Lab with Tim Marks and Hassan Mansour in 2018 and 2017.

I am a recipient of the Ken Kennedy Institute for Information Technology Schlumberger Graduate Fellowship and the Texas Instruments Fellowship. 

Before coming to Rice, I graduated from St. Maryâ€™s University in San Antonio, TX with a B.S. in Physics (summa cum laude) in 2015.
